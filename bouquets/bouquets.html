					<h1>WEDDING FLOWERS IN DUBLIN AND LEINSTER</h1>

					<h2>OUR APPROACH TO YOUR WEDDING FLOWERS</h2>
					<div>
						<p>It may be said that your wedding is the most important day of your life. Whether this is true or not it is certainly one that should live long in your memory and all those involved in this very special occasion.</p>

					<div>
						<p>Your wedding flowers provide a very important visual part to this day. They can set a tone or theme, they can be used to enhance, complement or contrast, they are the finishing touch and the final flourish to your whole ensemble. So it is vital that you get the very best of expert advice.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>At Bloomerang we believe that each wedding is a unique event. As a result, we start out with a blank canvas. This is why we do not offer “wedding flower packages” or “off the shelf” wedding flower solutions. It doesn’t necessarily mean large or indeed expensive but it does mean that in order to provide you with the very best in terms of style, design and service we need to spend time with you – time to get to know you, your likes and dislikes and what you would like to achieve. The starting point in this process is a one to one consultation with one of our highly talented team of Dublin wedding florists.</p>

					<h2>WEDDING FLOWERS – AREAS THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER</h2>
					<section>
						<article>
							<ul>
								<li>Colour – do you want to blend and co-ordinate your colours for a subtle look or would you rather use bold, vibrant colours to accentuate and make impact instead.</li>
								<li>Texture – you may wish to use different combinations of flowers and foliage to influence whether your flowers are focal points in themselves or you might prefer flowers that enhance and co-ordinate with the style of the setting and / or the bride / bridesmaids gowns.</li>
								<li>Style and Detail – for instance, structured or modern style flower arrangements may look out of place in a traditional setting. Therefore a more flowing arrangement may be better suited. Similarly, an overly fussy bouquet may not suit the clean, elegant lines of a simple wedding gown. However, contrasting styles when used effectively can add dramatic impact.</li>
								<li>Size and Shape – the size and shape of arrangements and bouquets can have very particular effects. A petite bride could be overwhelmed by an overly large bouquet while the effect of a beautiful table arrangement may be reduced if it is not in the correct proportions to the table and room where it is placed.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We design and deliver gorgeous wedding flowers in Dublin, throughout Leinster and occasionally further afield. For expert advice, regardless of whether you are planning a small intimate wedding or something more lavish, please use the contact form below to get in touch with our Dublin Wedding Florists to arrange a free one to one consultation.</p>
