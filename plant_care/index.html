                    <h1>How To Care Of Your Cut Flowers And Hand-Tied Bouquets</h1>
                        <section>
                            <p>In order to enjoy your hand-tied bouquet or bunch of cut flowers as long as possible, prepare a thoroughly clean vase, adding fresh water at room temperature mixed with Neill Strain Floral Couture flower food as instructed on the sachet. Flower food is our recommended way to extend the life of your beautiful flowers as it contains the correct mixture of ingredients to nourish them whilst keeping bacteria at bay.</p>

                            <p>Remove the gift packaging, allowing the flowers to breathe. Please do not cut the binding cord around the stems if your bouquet has been hand tied and you wish to keep it arranged as designed.</p>

                            <p>Cut each stem at an angle with a sharp knife or scissors, removing 2.5cm (1 inch) from the base of the stem. Ensure that all foliage below the water line has been removed. Foliage floating in water creates bacteria which is harmful to the flowers and will shorten their vase life.</p>

                            <p>Place the cut flowers in the vase and then move the vase to the desired place, away from direct sunlight, radiators and air conditioning units. Flowers do not like extreme heat, cold or drafts. Also, avoid proximity to fruit as fruit naturally produces ethylene as it ripens and this odourless gas will shorten the vase life of your flowers.</p>

                            <p>Maintain your flowers by removing any dead or dying flowers and any foliage that has fallen in the water.  Top up with clean water daily if necessary. Ideally, re-cut the stems and change the water adding flower food every 3 days. Note very cold or hot water will stress the flowers so best to use water at room temperature.</p>

                    <h2>Important Notes</h2>
                       <ul>
                           <li>All flowers, foliage and berries are for decorative purposes. Some flowers and plants can be harmful if consumed.</li>
                           <li>Care should be taken to keep your flowers and foliage out of the reach of children and pets.</li>
                           <li>Please take care when positioning your floral display within your home or office as leakages and dampness from the water source can cause damage to delicate surfaces. Always place the vase or container onto a protective mat.</li>
                           <li>Remove all pollen from flowers as they open to avoid the risk of staining.</li>
                           <li>Flower food should not be consumed.</li>
